user enters site and can choose to sign in or register
	if user has an account they click sign in and are presented with the login form
		after entering their user name and password they are taken to their account page
			account page shows information like games in progress and w/l ratio
			user can click on create game to start new game or click on an existing game to continue that one
		user clicks on new game
			a game-id is created, likely using the primary key
			the user is then taken to their board where they can set up their pieces
			there will be a ready button that validates that all pieces have been placed
			clicking this button will toggle their ready state
			when another user is found their name will appear in a sidebar along with their status (ready - not ready)

	user does not have an account so they click register
		registration form is displayed and they enter their information
			validation is performed to ensure a unique username and email address
			validation is performed to ensure passwords match (should we just have a show password toggle option instead of a confirm field?)
